# TestBench
## Licence
Note that while this project is licenced under AGPL v3 (Tl;DR anyone who distributes a modified version of the code must make said modifications available) and adding new modules counts as modifying the code, I have serious questions if you decide to have TestBench modules running publicly. Therefore, realistically the license should not be a hindrance at all.
